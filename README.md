# Self_driving_car_model
Designing a small prototype for self driving car.  Change steeering angles with respect to road.  Using car dash cam images and sterring images    Dataset used  from SullyChen----  https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow

# From above plot we can say that there are more datapoints with steering angle of 0. Probably the car is travellling more on a straight highway roads.
